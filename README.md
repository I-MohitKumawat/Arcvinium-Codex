# Arcvinium Codex

This repository is a collaborative space for beginners looking to build practical coding skills that go beyond standard university curricula. It’s designed to help learners gain job-ready abilities through structured learning, hands-on projects, and real-world examples.

Whether you’re just starting out or want a portfolio to showcase your skills, this repo provides a clear roadmap from first steps in programming to contributing to open-source projects.


## Learning Roadmap

1. **GitHub & Version Control**

Learn to use Git and GitHub: repositories, commits, branches, pull requests.

Practice cloning, pushing, pulling, and merging changes.

Optional: host simple projects with GitHub Pages.

2. **Programming Language** (Choose one: Python, Java, or JavaScript)

Basics: syntax, variables, control flow, functions, loops, and data structures.

Focus on practical usage rather than theory.

3. **Clean Code Practices**

Meaningful variable/function names.

Consistent formatting and indentation.

Modular, reusable code.

Proper commenting and documentation.

4. **Small Projects**

Start simple: calculator, to-do list, basic web scraper.

Document your work on GitHub.

Gradually scale up to slightly bigger projects to showcase understanding.

5. **Data Structures & Algorithms** (DSA)

Focus on core concepts: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hashmaps, graphs.

Solve practice problems:

50 easy

50 medium

20 hard

Platforms: LeetCode, HackerRank, Codewars.

6. **Databases**

Learn either MongoDB or SQL (or both).

Practice basic CRUD operations, queries, and simple database design.

Integrate with your small projects.

7. **Open Source Contribution**

Find beginner-friendly repositories to contribute to.

Submit pull requests and collaborate using GitHub workflow.

This adds real-world experience to your portfolio.


## TL;DR 
A beginner-friendly repo showcasing practical coding skills:

- Projects: Multiple small apps demonstrating Python/JavaScript/Java and clean code principles.

- Problem-Solving: 120+ DSA problems solved (easy → hard) on LeetCode.

- Databases & APIs: SQL/MongoDB integration in projects.

- Collaboration: Open-source contributions with GitHub workflow.
